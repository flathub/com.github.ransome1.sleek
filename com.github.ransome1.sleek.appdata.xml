    <p>sleek is an open-source todo app that makes use of the todo.txt format. sleeks GUI is modern and simple but still offers a decent set of functions which help users getting things done. sleek is available as a client for Windows, MacOS and Linux.</p>
    <p>Users can add contexts, projects, priorities, due dates or recurrences to their todos. These todo.txt attributes can then be used as filters or to group and sort the todo list.</p>
    <p>sleek manages and watches multiple todo.txt files continuously for changes, which makes it easy to integrate sleek with other todo.txt apps. Also users can switch between bright and dark mode and choose from multiple languages.</p>
    <p>Todos with due date or repeating todos will trigger notifications and completed todos can be hidden or archived into separate done.txt files. If users have tons of todos, a compact view can come in handy.</p>
    <p>Features</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An existing todo.txt file can be used or a new one can be created</li>
      <li>Todos can be added, edited, marked as complete (and vice versa) or deleted</li>
      <li>A todo can be hidden (add "h:1") but its attributes will appear in filter list and auto complete</li>
      <li>Existing todos can be used as templates for new ones</li>
